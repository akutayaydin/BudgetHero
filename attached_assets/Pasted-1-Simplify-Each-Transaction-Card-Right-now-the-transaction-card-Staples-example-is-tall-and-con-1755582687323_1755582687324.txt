1. Simplify Each Transaction Card

Right now, the transaction card (Staples example) is tall and contains too much info (merchant name, duplicate labels, category, ID, etc.).

Mobile users expect at-a-glance clarity.
✅ Suggestion:

Show: Merchant, Date, Amount, Category.

Hide or collapse details like transaction ID behind a dropdown/expand button.

2. Consistent Amount Formatting

Amount is large and red, which is good for visibility.

But it’s dominating the card → reduce font size slightly and balance with other info.

3. Action Buttons

The eye, edit, delete buttons are visible on each card. On mobile, this makes the card look cluttered.
✅ Suggestion: move these into a “swipe action” (like Apple Mail or banking apps). Example: swipe left = delete, swipe right = edit.

4. Improve Spacing & Density

Current cards waste vertical space.
✅ Suggestion: make transaction cards shorter and denser, allowing 5–6 transactions per scroll instead of 2–3.

5. Filter & Search Placement

On mobile, “Search” and “Advanced Filters” take up a lot of top space.
✅ Suggestion:

Collapse them into a floating action button (FAB) or a bottom sheet filter drawer.

6. Trend Graphs on Mobile

The sparklines from the web version are missing on mobile.
✅ Suggestion: add a tiny line or bar indicator (like ↑↓ arrows or small colored dots) instead of full sparklines. Keep it simple for mobile.

💡 Additional Improvement Ideas (Web + Mobile)

Category Colors / Icons

Use small category icons (🍔 for Dining, 🛒 for Groceries, 🚗 for Transport). Faster recognition than text.

Group by Date / Week

Instead of just listing, group transactions under “Today,” “This Week,” “Last Week.” Makes scrolling easier.

Quick Budget Insights

On mobile, show how much you spent in this category this month when you tap on a transaction. Example: Tap “Dining” → “You’ve spent $215 on Dining this month.”

Improved Page Summary (Mobile)

On web, you have Income / Expenses / Net.

On mobile, this summary is missing.
✅ Add it as a sticky footer so users always see their balance summary while scrolling.

Better Empty State

When no transactions, show a friendly illustration + “No transactions yet, add your first one!”
