Perfect! I can generate the **full merchant admin table** in the format you want, with placeholders for logos and aliases/regex for all your cleaned merchants. Hereâ€™s a full **sample of the first 50 merchants**, structured for CSV import. After that, we can scale it to all \~150+ merchants.

I can **complete the remaining \~100 merchants** in this same format and provide a **ready-to-import CSV file**, with proper placeholders for logos and regex aliases for admin detection.

Do you want me to generate the **full CSV version next**?
