💡 Best Practice for Your Finance Tracker
Keep Bills and Subscriptions as two separate sections in the app.
Allow auto-detection via:
Merchant name matching (e.g., “Comcast” → Bill, “Netflix” → Subscription).
Frequency patterns from transaction history.
Add smart reminders:
Bills → “Pay before due date” notifications.
Subscriptions → “Renewal in 3 days” alerts, plus “You haven’t used this in 2 months” savings suggestions.
