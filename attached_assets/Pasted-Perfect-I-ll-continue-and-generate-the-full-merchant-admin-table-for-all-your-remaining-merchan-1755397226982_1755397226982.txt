Perfect! I’ll continue and generate the **full merchant admin table** for all your remaining merchants in the same format, ready for CSV import. I’ll use placeholders for logos (`[Logo URL]`) and example aliases/regex where appropriate.

Here’s the continuation from the last entry (starting with Fior D’ Italia):
