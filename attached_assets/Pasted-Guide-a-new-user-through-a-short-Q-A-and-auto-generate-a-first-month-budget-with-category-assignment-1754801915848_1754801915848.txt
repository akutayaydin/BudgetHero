Living Wage Calculator
Income
Net monthly income (preferred) or gross + pay frequency (derive net with simple table; user can edit)

Data & Defaults (how we fill gaps)
Baseline allocation starts from the 50/30/20 framework (needs/wants/saving), then adjusts for local costs & family profile.

Needs share uses BLS Consumer Expenditure shares (housing, food, transport, healthcare) as guardrails to avoid unrealistic splits.

Local living costs (food, childcare, medical, housing assumptions) reference MIT Living Wage for the user’s metro/family type; we do not copy their dollar values, we benchmark ranges and surface warnings if the user’s plan is far below typical.

Rent reasonableness check against HUD’s 30% rule; show a warning banner if cost-burdened.

Utilities estimate (if blank): use EIA national/state averages; show “regional typical” note with kWh price context.

Transportation (car): prefill with AAA Your Driving Costs (fuel ¢/mile, insurance, maintenance); compute miles × cost/mile, user can override each subline.

Childcare: preload state average annual → monthly.

Budget Template (Month 1)
Category list with Assigned amounts and rationale.
“Needs vs Wants vs Saving” summary with percentages and color bands.
Alerts: Housing cost-burdened, Underfunded emergency fund, High transport vs local norms.
Explainer Panel
For each category: “Why this amount?” → shows which inputs/rules/sources influenced the number (e.g., “Based on AAA $0.149/mi × 900 mi”).

One-click Tweaks
Buttons: “Reduce Wants 10%”, “Boost Savings to 20%”, “Rebalance to 50/30/20”, “Match Living-Wage Basket”.
Category Schema (seed)
Income: Salary, Tips/Gig
Housing (Needs): Rent/Mortgage, Renter/Home Insurance, Electricity, Gas, Water/Sewer, Internet, Phone
Food (Needs): Groceries, Work/School Lunch
Transport (Needs): Fuel/Charging, Insurance, Maintenance, Registration/Parking, Transit Pass
Childcare/Education (Needs): Childcare, After-School, Tuition/Books
Health (Needs): Health Insurance, Medical/Dental/Prescriptions
Debt: Credit Card Minimums (needs), Loan Interest (expense), Loan Principal (debt principal)
Savings/Investing: Emergency Fund, Retirement/Investing
Wants: Dining, Entertainment, Shopping, Travel, Subscriptions, Gym
(ledger types set per earlier spec so P/L is clean)
Allocation Logic (algorithm)
Start with 50/30/20 targets on net income. 
Investopedia
Pin user-entered hard costs first: Rent/Mortgage, Debt minimums, known Subscriptions.
Fill mandatory needs using guardrails:
Utilities = user value else EIA state avg baseline (editable). 
U.S. Energy Information Administration
Transport (car) = miles × AAA ¢/mi with sublines; Transit = entered pass. 
AAA Newsroom
Childcare = state average if selected care type, editable. 
Child Care Aware® of America
Groceries = start from MIT basket for household type × local adjustment (informational benchmark), then round to fit budget. 
Living Wage Calculator
Check housing burden: if Housing >30% → show warning + auto-rebalance suggestion (reduce Wants first, then non-essential Needs; never reduce minimum debt or essential utilities/childcare).
HUD User
Savings: ensure at least 10% if 20% not feasible; if user set emergency-fund months, compute target and propose auto-transfer.
Wants get the remainder; cap negative categories at zero and flag conflicts.
Sanity pass vs BLS shares (housing/food/transport/health): if any >2× typical share, raise a soft warning.

Acceptance Criteria
A1: Given only net income, ZIP, and rent, the system produces a balanced budget using defaults and flags housing burden if >30%. 
HUD User
A2: If user picks Car and enters 900 miles, Transport shows AAA-based estimate with line items the user can edit. 
AAA Newsroom
A3: With 1 child, center-based care, childcare initializes to the state monthly average (editable).
Child Care Aware® of America
A4: “Why this amount?” explains the calculation and cites which input or benchmark influenced it (e.g., EIA avg bill for the state). 
U.S. Energy Information Administration
A5: One-click “Rebalance to 50/30/20” adjusts categories while preserving pinned hard costs.
Investopedia
A6: Budget writes Assigned amounts for all categories and is saved as the user’s Month 1 plan.

Internationalization: keep a switch for non-US (skip HUD/MIT/EIA-specific checks).
